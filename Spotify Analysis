-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- The data includes the top 50 most listened to songs in the world for year 2021 on Spotify.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- How many artists are featured in this list of 50 songs?  

SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- Of the 35 distinct artists, which have multiple tracks on the list,
-- and which artists have the most tracks?

SELECT
    artist_name,
    COUNT(id)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(id) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC;

-- List the tracks from most to least popular.

SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name,
    popularity,
    danceability,
    speechiness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

-- There are some tracks with the same popularity score.
-- I'll count the tracks grouped by score, and order them by popularity.

SELECT
    popularity,
    COUNT(id)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

-- Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table.
-- Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, 
-- show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH CTE AS 
    (
    SELECT
        artist_name,
        ROUND(AVG(popularity),2) AS avg_popularity
    FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
    ORDER BY AVG(popularity) DESC
    )
SELECT
    artist_name,
    avg_popularity,
    "Top Star" AS label
FROM CTE
WHERE avg_popularity >= 90;
